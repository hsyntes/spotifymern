## React-Query Integration

React-Query is used to fetch and manage data in the frontend. The library provides hooks for fetching data from the backend API, caching responses, and handling loading and error states.

## Redux Integration

Redux is used for global state management in the frontend. It stores user authentication information, such as the JWT token, and manages user-related actions like logging in and logging out.

## React-Router Integration

React-Router is used for client-side routing, allowing smooth navigation between different pages and managing URLs for specific content.

### SpotifyMERN Backend API
